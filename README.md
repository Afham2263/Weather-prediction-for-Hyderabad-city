# 🌤️ Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Weather Prediction Project! 🌈 This project predicts the temperature of a given city using historical weather data. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, and visualizes both historical and predicted temperature trends.

## Features
- 🌍 Fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- 📊 Processes and cleans the weather data for accurate predictions.
- 🔮 Forecasts the temperature for the next 7 days.
- 📈 Visualizes historical and predicted temperature data using Matplotlib.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weatherPrediction
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. 🗝️ Ensure you have your OpenWeatherMap API key.
2. 🔧 Update the API key in your code (if necessary).
3. 🚀 Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

## Data

The historical weather data will be saved in the `data` directory as `current_weather_data.csv`. 📂 Ensure this file is available for processing.

## Visualization

The project will generate visualizations displaying the historical temperature data alongside the predicted temperatures for the next week. 🌡️
